        The ridge is the site of the present-day beach.[11] When Fort St. George
        was built in 1640, the sea was too close to the fort. The building of
        the harbor near the fort resulted in sand accretion to the south of the
        fort and the harbor and the sea, which was washing the ramparts of the
        fort, moved afar at about 2.5 km away from the fort creating a wide
        beach between the land and the sea.
